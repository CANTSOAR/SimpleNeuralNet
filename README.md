# SimpleNeuralNet
this was the bulk of my learning of neural networks, done by doing everything from scratch (I failed on lstms :( )


there is a DNN, an RNN, and an LSTM in this thing

The DNN was made by learning from the nnfs book and by working out the math in all the pngs
The RNN was cmopletely freehand, based entirely on my past knowledge and calc abilities
the LSTM made me want to quit coding forever...
